      <h2> about me: </h2>
      <p> Ever since i was a kid, i was always passionate about technology in general. I loved to hear about the progress and inovation of all the things around us in our world, and i've always wanted to pursue a career doing something related to that. Le Wagon has introduced me to programming and i have been loving to learn about how everything works "behind the scenes" of what most people usually take for granted.
      My hobbies revolve around gaming, watching a movie together with friends or just hanging out with people i like really.
